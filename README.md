Project Structure
The project is currently organized into two main directories: one for RStudio and another for Stata.

RStudio Directory
  Contains an "Exploratory analysis" subfolder with all scripts used for statistical analysis and database construction on the Banco de la Rep√∫blica servers.

Stata Directory
  Includes an "Exploratory analysis" subfolder with Dofiles for generating global statistics.
  The "Regression analysis" subfolder is dedicated to the Diff-in-Diff estimations that have been developed throughout the project.

This structure helps to maintain a clear division between exploratory analyses and regression models, ensuring ease of navigation and collaboration.
